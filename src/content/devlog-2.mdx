Part Two: The Anatomy of a Great Indie Game Devlog
--------------------------------------------------

### Intro

In the first part of this article we explained why devlogs are an essential tool for an indie developer, and when and where you should start posting them.

Now, we’ll dive into the details of an effective devlog.

What should you include in your devlog? What should you avoid at all costs? How can you appeal to your audience and create a loyal, supportive fanbase for your game?

Let’s dive in!

### Essential Steps to Creating a Great Devlog

Unfortunately, we can’t tell _exactly_ what to include to make your devlogs great. This will vary depending on your game, your audience, and your personality.

However, we can give some pretty solid guidelines.

Keep in mind that you’ll create _a lot_ of these over the course of your project. There’s plenty of time to improve and learn as you go. The most important thing is that you start getting your game out there, even if you’re nervous at first.

#### Include Tangible Progress

The most uninteresting devlogs are ones that only talk about your grand plans for the game, with no substance to back them up.

Every devlog you make should include tangible progress.

This progress doesn’t have to be huge, or even very impressive, it just has to be there. It could be a new piece of concept art, some fresh assets or a new minor system.

Of course, if you do have a huge new feature, great! But remember, not every devlog will be a showstopper. The important thing is that they’re regular, and you show your audience that you’re making progress each week, even if it's slow.

We can see an example in [this update](https://www.indiedb.com/games/shadows-of-doubt/news/shadows-of-doubt-devblog-27-populating-the-population-clothes) about the detective sim game _[Shadows of Doubt](https://colepowered.com/shadows-of-doubt/),_ created by ColePowered Games.

You could argue that the progress shown in this update is pretty minor, just some new clothing pieces in the game's simple, voxel style. But, by including a breakdown of the unique clothing system, and some nice images of the new assets, the update is still satisfying and interesting.

It’s a confirmation by the developers that “_yes, we’re still chipping away”._

If you don’t feel like your week's progress is enough to show in your devlog, you could break down an existing system in greater detail. These devlogs tend to appeal to a narrower audience, those who are interested in the more technical side of games, but are still perfectly acceptable.

Just make sure you give your audience something substantial once a month or so and it’ll be fine. If you stay in touch, people will be patient.

Understandably, it can be hard to find the time to make weekly devlogs when you’re knee deep in the game dev swamp of sadness. If you’re part of a development team, a great way of lightening this load is by rotating the person writing the log each week.

This not only gives the others a break, but also gives a new, interesting perspective each time.

#### Keep it Short and Sweet

This really can’t be overstated. Whatever you do in your devlogs, _don’t_ drone on about nothing.

Whether you’re creating text or video logs, going on long, boring tangents is an easy way to lose your audience. It’s the age of the internet; people have TikTok attention spans. Keep things short and interesting, and avoid long stretches of nothing.

Your devlogs don’t have to enrapture people, but they should be pleasant to read or watch.

Always edit your script or text, and be ruthless when you cut things out. If something is boring, repetitive or unnecessary, it’s got to go. Bullet points and diagrams are your friends.

Remember to hook people in the first few sentences or seconds of your log. Start with a taste of something really interesting, then dive into the details once you’ve got their attention. A video clip or image of your new features is great for this.

#### Make it Visually Interesting and Entertaining

Your devlogs aren’t strictly “entertainment”, but they should be enjoyable in some way. If you can make them interesting and fun, you’ll gain eyes on your project and spread the reach of your game.

People want to see new stuff ASAP. Start off with an image or video of your new features.

We can see this in the [Harag Marshlands update](https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1527950/view/3096794565653039227) from the _Wartales_ development team. Right away, you see a gorgeous painting of the new area, and a mysterious description that hints at its secrets. The swampy landscape and ruined architecture is completely different to what’s already in the game, which existing players will notice immediately.

Once you’ve hooked people, you can dive deeper into your new features.

Using images and videos as much as possible will greatly improve your devlogs impact. They’re striking, and much easier understood by people without gamedev experience.

If your work has been on technical features, avoid showing screenshots of raw code.

Instead, include a video of the feature working in-engine. This is much more accessible and exciting for your audience.

Bugs are another fan-favorite devlog feature. Funny bugs are excellent ways to keep people engaged in your devlog, and add some fun to your more technical updates

If you’ve been working on art, timelapses are an excellent way of creating interest in your devlog. They’re satisfying, interesting and (best of all) easy to make. Just record yourself drawing, painting, modeling, or even developing in-engine, and speed it up in a video editing software.

They also make a great background in a video as you talk about your work.

If you choose video as your devlog format, make sure to spend time on your editing. Include things like checklists, diagrams and moving graphics as you explain new features. These help keep people engaged, and makes for a nicer viewing experience.

#### Tell People How to Access More Information About Your Project

This might seem obvious, but is still overlooked - tell people about your game and how to find out more about it in your devlogs.

A great example can be seen in the _[Shadows of Doubt devlog](https://www.indiedb.com/games/shadows-of-doubt/news/shadows-of-doubt-devblog-27-populating-the-population-clothes)_ we mentioned earlier.

  
Notice the big, obvious block of text at the top of the update that includes a blurb about the game, as well as its Steam page, Discord server and main blog page.

If you’re making a video devlog, you should start straight away with the name of your game, and an extremely brief plug. Something like “Hey! I’ve been developing this game called \[name\] about \[interesting element\], and now I’ve added \[new thing\]!”

Make sure your video description has links to your other social media, and any other pages related to your game.

It should be easy for someone who’s stumbled across your devlog to find out more about your project, and become part of your community.

#### Don’t Shy Away From Showing Humor and Personality

When people follow an indie game’s development, they aren't looking for the cold, corporate communication of a AAA company.

A major appeal of indie games is that they’re made by average people. Fans can interact with developers and feel far more involved in the game’s development than they ever could with the latest CoD.

Don’t be afraid to show your personality in your devlogs.

Make jokes, reference memes, post pet pics and talk about your experience as a developer. This will all create an entertaining update, and make your audience feel more connected to you.

Videos are especially good for this. They give you a face (or at least, a voice) that makes you human, rather than a robot behind a screen. People tend to be much more patient with a humanized developer.

Whatever you do, don’t force it.

If you’re a loud, outgoing person, let that shine! If you’re reserved and chill, that’s fine too. Be yourself and you’ll find an audience that appreciates your authenticity. Nothing’s more off putting than someone obviously trying too hard to be something they’re not.

Show your excitement for your game, and the new things you’ve made. Emotions are contagious. If you’re excited, your audience will be too.

When you start out, you’ll almost definitely be awkward and unsure. It’s normal.

Over time, you’ll gain experience and get more comfortable. Breathe, and don’t stress too much about being perfect and entertaining for every moment of your devlog.

#### Be Honest About Your Experience, Even When Things Are Tough

Game development isn’t all sunshine and rainbows. Often, it’s tough. Every developer eventually gets sick of staring at their project day after day, and hits a point where they struggle to continue.

As we said, people don’t seek out indie developers for sanitized, corporate interactions.

If you have a difficult experience in development, maybe a bug that completely breaks your spirit for a couple of days, talk about it.

Your audience will appreciate authenticity over plastic hyper-optimism.

Most of all, people love a success story of overcoming insurmountable obstacles. Document your experience of struggling and overcoming these things. Create a satisfying narrative from your journey.

A story with setbacks and challenges is far more interesting than one with effortless success.

Of course, you shouldn’t wallow in pity all the time either. That isn’t good for you or your community. Instead, just be honest and present a balanced depiction of your experience as a developer.

#### Create and Strengthen a Connection With Your Community

An indie games community is its lifeblood. There is no finding success as an indie developer without creating a strong community around your game.

Devlogs are a major part of building this connection with your audience.

We’ve already covered how they humanize you as a developer. However, beyond this, they also demonstrate your appreciation for your community.

Engage with your audience. If inside jokes arise from your game, use them in your logs. Show people that you’re listening and you care about their love for your game. A heard community is a happy one.

Seeing the very first piece of fan art for your game is an awe-inspiring, incredible moment.  
  
If people create art or mods for your game, you can showcase these in your devlogs occasionally. The _Zomboid_ team has a [weekly mod showcase](https://projectzomboid.com/blog/news/2023/08/mod-spotlight-notloc/).

This shows how much you appreciate the people who truly love your game, and contribute to its community. This will encourage more people to do the same, and make your biggest fans feel seen.

Most importantly, be pleasant and treat everyone with kindness and patience.

The internet can be a harsh place. There will be cruel and intentionally obtuse people, but they aren’t the ones who matter. Focus on those who love your game and support your work.

Just remember you can’t make everyone happy, especially the millions of people who may stumble upon you on the internet. As _Stormworks_ developer [Dan Walters said](https://www.gamedeveloper.com/blogs/quick-dev-insights-04---building-a-community---dan-walters), _“Treat everyone equally, but remember you are only a game developer.”_

### Conclusion

In the end, much of creating a great devlog is gained through experience.

Over time, you’ll learn how your game’s community works, and what they respond best to. You’ll build a unique relationship with them that is different for every game.

By following these points, you can build this community through engaging, informative devlogs. Hopefully, this process will be rewarding, and even push you along when gamedev gets tough.

Good luck, and know that good things come with time and patience.
