Part One: The Basics of Devlogs, and Why They’re Essential for any Indie Game Developer
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Intro

Creating games is easier than ever. The internet has given us a treasure trove of tools and knowledge, letting anyone with enough determination bring their idea to life.

At the same time, the indie game market is flooded each day by new titles of _varying_ quality. There are gems, like _Hades_ or _Stardew Valley_, but for each diamond in the rough there’s a dozen games that are… well, rough.

Amongst the thousands of people trying to do the same thing, how do you, as an indie developer, stand out in the crowd? How do you build hype and interest around your game?

There are a number of things you need to achieve this. Most importantly you need a good game idea, but you’ll also need marketing, publicity and, unfortunately, a healthy dose of luck.

A major part of building your game’s fanbase, and sustaining its loyalty, is creating devlogs.

With some skill, and a little style, your devlogs will build a fanbase that is engaged, loyal and always growing. They are a major piece in the eldritch puzzle that is finding success as an indie game developer, and becoming [one of the 5% of indie game projects that actually make a profit.](https://docs.google.com/document/u/1/d/1JV780_Rc6PqQKf6PLlzkdr8EPvlf8C2aNSR9ROCpP5Q/mobilebasic)

In this two-part series, we’ll cover everything you need to know about writing great devlogs, and how they can help your project reach its potential.

# What is a Devlog?

In games, a devlog is an update created by a developer about their game project. It can take many forms and span countless websites.

The main purpose of a devlog is to gather interest and excitement from potential players, and keep them engaged with your project throughout its development. It’s an important part of building your game’s community, which is crucial to any indie project.

The style, tone and content of devlogs varies greatly between developers and projects. Some are casual and funny, others are highly technical, and some are dramatic and narrative-heavy.

## Are They Actually Worth the Effort?

Writing a regular devlog requires time and effort. You might argue this is time and effort that _could_ be spent on your game, a waste.

However, devlogs serve many purposes, and are honestly essential to seeing success as an indie developer. Indie games thrive on publicity and fans, and devlogs are a major part of building this kind of community around your game.

There are hundreds of great games that are never noticed in the modern indiepocalypse. Being great isn’t enough. You need to be seen.

### Building Visibility for Your Project

Unless you have an established fanbase, blindly releasing a game no one knows anything about will rarely be successful.

Devlogs give you a chance to build hype around your project before it’s even out.

You can post videos of new features, images of assets you’ve created, and describe your plans for the game. Over time, this will draw in people who are interested in your project.

When you finally reach your release date, this pre-built audience will be the jumping off point of your games success.

A fanbase is also a natural visibility generator. If people like what you’re making, they’ll spread the word, maybe even creating amazing art and fan works around your concept. Once you get the ball rolling, you may find your community starts building itself.

### Motivation During Development

As you develop your game, devlogs can be a great way to stay motivated.

They hold you accountable. When you know hundreds or even thousands of people are excited for your next update, it makes you want to keep going, to create something you can be proud to show.

Releasing devlogs can be really energizing, especially once you build a dedicated fanbase (even if it’s a small one). Positive responses to new features is an instant endorphin boost.

As you establish yourself in the indie game scene online, you’ll quickly discover the incredibly supportive, kind community that’s built there.

Of course, it’s the internet, and people will be mean sometimes.

However, for the most part, the online indie game community is a lovely place to be, with lots of support for those who are passionate and genuine in their attempts to create great games. Other developers, especially, are a great source of support and advice.

### Early Feedback and Playtesting

Once your game gains a following, you’ll quickly find this fanbase is a great source of feedback and playtesting.

If you get an unusual amount of kickback for a new feature, you know to step back and reconsider. If one of your systems just isn’t working, or there’s a major pain point in your new demo, you’ll quickly hear about it.

Playtesting is a huge part of creating a polished, fun final product. Don’t underestimate the importance of gathering lots of varied playtesting data.

## When and How to Post Your Devlogs

It can feel intimidating starting a devlog series.

There are so many formats and styles you could use, but which are right for you and your game? When should you release your first devlog?

The answer to this is complicated, and different for every person. But, we can give a few guidelines to help you get going.

### Start Early, Start Strong

Ideally, you should release your first devlog as soon as you have something to show.

Countless people have great _ideas_ for games. But, only a few have the skill and determination to actually _create_ a game.

A first devlog filled with ideas, but no substance, will make people roll their eyes. Projects that start like this often go unfinished, with their creator able to come up with heaps of exciting ideas, but not able to withstand the slog that game development becomes later on.

To show you aren’t just an “ideas guy”, include something substantial in your first devlog.

By this, we mean something beyond written concepts. This doesn’t mean you need a fully functioning prototype, but something like concept art, your first few assets, or a basic feature implemented in-engine are all perfect things to start with.

A great example is the life-sim _[Paralives](https://www.paralives.com/)_, a game unreleased at time of writing, but with a _very_ healthy fanbase around it.

Alex Massé, the original developer, posted his [first devlog](https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1118520/view/1703979556401647294) when he’d only created some very basic assets, and laid the groundwork for a simple building system. He included gifs of these features and soon caught the attention of the internet.

If he’d shown up with ideas but no substance, he’d probably have been dismissed as yet another Sims fan tired of EA. By presenting actual work that showed his abilities as a developer, he got people excited, because they saw he could actually follow through on the project.

Starting as early as you can gives you plenty of time to build up momentum. No project gains popularity overnight; you’ll have to regularly interact with your audience for a long time before you’ll see real rewards.

Expect your first few devlogs to get crickets in response.

  
As long as you are making something interesting, and you keep shouting about it wherever you can, people will start to notice eventually.

#### Make a Schedule and Stick to It

This is one of the most important parts of making devlogs that actually work. A good update frequency is once a week, though this can vary between devs. Just make sure they aren’t so frequent that people feel like you’re spamming them.

Your devlogs are a regular message to your fans that you’re still around and making progress. Indie games are often abandoned, leaving fans frustrated and unfulfilled, so reassuring them that you’re still engaged will keep your community growing.

Part of the appeal of following an indie game is getting to see it slowly come together, kind of living vicariously through the developer.

Keeping your fans updated gives them this satisfaction, and keeps them coming back.

A regular schedule will also keep you motivated and accountable, knowing you’ll have to present your progress to your audience each week. Game development can feel like an unending slog sometimes. Knowing so many people are anxiously awaiting your update can give you that little push to keep going, even when you’re exhausted.

It should be noted that once you have this regular schedule, breaking it unexpectedly can very quickly undo your work.

Fans are always wary of developers suddenly abandoning their game. If they think this has happened, your audience will quickly hemorrhage. If you need to take a break, let your fans know ahead of time, and always stay in touch if you can.

### Who Are You Writing For?

It's important to understand your audience when creating your devlogs.

There’s a reason every game has a different tone, style and content in their updates; their audiences are completely different. You should consider what your audience is interested in hearing about.

Would they like highly technical breakdowns of new systems? Do they want pretty pictures and exciting new assets? Would they respond well to humor?

A lot of this can be experimented with as you go - letting you adjust to what works best over time.

As an example of these differences, let's look at two indie games with very different styles.

_[Project Zomboid](https://projectzomboid.com/blog/)_ is a survival RPG by The Indie Stone initially released in 2011 as a tech demo, and now in beta. They have weekly devlogs talking about the team’s latest work.

_[Wartales](https://wartales.net/)_ is a tactical RPG developed by Shiro Games, released as a full version in 2023. They release irregular devlogs as they develop new features for the next major update.

Let’s compare [this devlog](https://projectzomboid.com/blog/news/2023/06/snack-attack/) by the Zomboid team to [this one](https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1527950/view/3096794565653039227) by the Wartales team.

_Wartales_ is very narrative-focused, with a strong emphasis on engaging, dramatic storylines. Their language is serious and descriptive. In many cases, they only vaguely describe new features, intentionally leaving some parts obscured to excite players about discovering more when they play.

_“But \[after entering a new area\], if your group makes too much noise things might become trickier…”_

The developers know that their audience cares about interesting stories, and new mysteries to uncover. This is at the heart of their game, and the main appeal of playing it. Jokes and deep-dives into systems aren’t interesting to their playerbase. Narrative is.

On the other hand, _Project Zomboid’s_ devlog is completely different.

They start off with a joke, _“another dev-log sent down from the mothership”_, immediately setting the tone of the update as casual, funny and unserious. Instead of cryptically hinting about story elements, they explain a new system in detail, breaking down exactly how it works behind the scenes.

_Zomboid_ is beloved by its community for its extreme level of detail, complex systems and challenging survival environment. It’s completely dynamic, with far more focus on emergent storytelling than any hard-set narrative.

The fanbase is far more interested in how the game works, how their gameplay will be impacted, than any mysterious new story beats.

Because there is no serious narrative immersion being upheld here, the devs are free to make jokes and engage more casually with their audience. The Zomboid community has plenty of inside jokes, and, despite the bleak subject matter of the game, are a friendly, light-hearted group. The devs reflect this tone.

In short, know who you’re talking to in your logs. Understand your audience, and appeal to what they care about most.

### Text vs Video Formats

The classic format for devlogs is a simple text blog.

Text lets you break things down in detail, and is more easily spread across the web. You can post snippets to places like Twitter to gain as much visibility as possible.

It’s also a great way of explaining technical details in a controlled way. You can create subheadings, diagrams and use images to get your message across. People can read at their own pace, making complex subjects more accessible.

Text updates are also a lot easier to make. They take some time, but nothing compared to a fully edited video. Once you get used to writing them, a text devlog takes very little time to whip up.

However, text isn’t very personal. It can make you feel less humanized to your audience, and thus make them feel less connected to you.

Video, on other hand, is currently the most stylish way of making devlogs.

It lets you add flashy graphics, moving diagrams and, most importantly, heaps of video of your work. Videos are engaging, and an easy way to draw a regular audience. They’re also far more likely to be stumbled across by people unfamiliar with your game.

Because you connect more with your audience in a video format, they’ll feel closer to you and your project, and be more loyal. You can build a strong fanbase with regular video updates.

However, videos take a lot of effort and time to create.

The more flashy and fancy your graphics, the longer it will take to put your log together each week. After all, you still need to, y’know, work on your game.

### Which Platform Is Best for Devlogs?

There’s no easy answer here - it really depends on your game and the audience that are interested in it.

Ideally, you should post your devlogs everywhere you can. Many developers post their updates in several places each week, and post links to places like Twitter or YouTube Community.

A dedicated website for your game is an option if you have the money and skills. It’s a great way of showing you’re serious about the project, and gives full control over your style and layout. However, it also needs more upkeep and initial investment.

Steam Updates are another highly visible way of posting devlogs. They can include images and videos, so can be fairly detailed.

YouTube is king when it comes to video devlogs. It’s a great way of being stumbled upon by people unfamiliar with your work, since YouTube will recommend your devlogs in their sidebar.

Many game sites like Itch.io and GameDev.net also have dedicated sections for devlogs.

  
Really, it’s best if you experiment to find what you like. In the end, what matters is that your devlogs are easily accessible and of high quality.
